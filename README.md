# terraform-learning
Learning Terraform on Windows and Linux

Learning Terraform is relatively easy. There are a lot of resources to help you along the way.

With this repository we will build the foundation of using Terraform to build a virtual machine
 - on a local vSphere server
 - in AWS
 - in Azure
 - in GCP
 
and build tools and scripts along the way to help build this foundation. We will focus on building
a development environment on Windows and Linux as well as building a Windows and Linux virtual machine 
in all four environments.
